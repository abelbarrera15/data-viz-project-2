        <h4>Data Link:</h4><a href= "https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer">European Soccer Database</a>
        <h4>About Dataset</h4>
        <p>This dataset contains team, player, and match data for European Professional Soccer from seasons 2008-2016. 
            There are 7 datasets in total that each relate with a key, either country, match, team id, etc. The datasets 
            included are Country, League, Match, Player, Player_attributes, Team, and Team_attributes.</p>
        <p>For the team and player data, there are columns of quantitative and qualitative data. Some examples of the 
            qualitative data are included in player_attributes and team_attributes such as a players preferred_foot, 
            attacking_work_rate and defensive_work_rate along with a teams buildUpPlaySpeedClass, chanceCreationPassingClass
             and others. </p> 
        <h4>Initial Questions:</h4>
        <li>What are the attributes of winning teams? 
        </li>
        <li>What are the qualities for specific players that contribute to a team’s win? 
        </li>
        <li>How can you visualize a whole season?
        </li>
        <li>How big was the margin of a win? 
        </li>
        <li>What, from a data perspective, does a large margin win look like vs. a small margin win?
        </li>
        <li>How do the in-game stats compare for each match?
        </li>
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <h4>Nodal Graph</h4>
        <p>As seen in the image below, we had the idea to create nodes that will represent a
             match. You start the visualization by filtering for league, season, and two teams. We 
             did this filtering because the graph would be too large and busy to be well understood.
              We played around with it but felt these filters gave us the best and most meaningful visual.</p>
        <p>Each node is a match shown by the two participating team logos. Every node is at least one 
            of the two teams filtered at the beginning. This creates a web for all the games played 
            by two teams in one league in a single season. We created a yellow box around the node 
            for when the two teams selected play each other. The arrows between the two teams represent 
            a match up. The arrows are color coordinated to the match outcome; blue is a win, red is 
            a loss, and gray is a tie.</p>
        <div class="sketches">
            <img src="node.jpg" width="300" height="400">
        </div>
        <p>The nodal graph answers the question of how to visualize an entire season. This graph can 
            also answer the question of if momentum could affect match outcomes. </p>
        <div class="sketches">
            <img src="node2.jpg" width="700" height="400">
        </div>
        <h4>Drill Down Graphs</h4>
        <p>Our goal is to add additional drill down or attribute items to the nodal graph. Within each 
            match of the overall graph, we wanted to create hover over abilities to show key indicators
             (comparing team attributes), players who made large impacts, and additional important 
             factors of the game. </p>
        <p>The first drill down graph is a radar graph designed to show the comparison between the two 
            teams in a match. The graph allows for a person to have a visual representation of the team's
             differences in their style of play. This allows us to answer the question of what are the
              attributes of a winning team.</p>
        <p>The different types of play include:</p>
        <li>buildUpPlaySpeed</li>
        <li>buildUpPlayPassing</li>
        <li>chanceCreationPassing</li>
        <li>chanceCreationShooting</li>
        <li>chanceCreationCrossing</li>
        <li>defencePressure</li>
        <li>defenceAggression</li>
        <li>defenceTeamWidth</li>
        <div class= "drilldown">
        <img src="drilldown.jpg" width="450" height="300">
        </div>
        <p>These attributes have a numeric value that is given in the original dataset. We created
             a function that takes in the match id based on which node you click on in our original
              node graph.</p>
        <p>The next drill down graph shown below the radar graph is a comparison of the two best players
             on the participating teams, determined by which players had the highest overall rating scores 
             for that match. With the given player attribute data, we decided that, besides the overall
              rating, the attributes that contribute to a highly rated player include acceleration, vision,
               jumping, and stamina. These attributes are gathered from the date of the match (as the 
               dataset contains attribute data for players over time) and compared visually with a bar
                chart. They are split by team, so the home team is on the left and away team is on the
                 right. Comparing each team's top player performance provides some additional insight
                  to a match. This graph appears along with the radar graph when a match is clicked on.
                   We decided on the colors taking into consideration colorblindness. We had started
                    with blue, orange, green, red, and purple but decided the blue, maroon, green, yellow,
                     and dark blue was easier to distinguish across all types of colorblindness.</p>
        <div class= "drilldown">
            <img src="drilldown2.jpg" width="600" height="350">
        </div>
        <p>The last drill down graph is actually two visuals. Along with the two visuals previously mentioned, when you
             click on a specific match on the node graph, you will see a bidirectional bar chart on the
              right. This bar chart shows the in-game statistics from the selected match. The in-game 
              statistics include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Goals</li>
         <li>Shots on Goal</li>
        <li>Shots off Goal</li>
        <li>Possessions</li>
        <li>Crosses</li>
        <li>Corner Kicks</li>
        <li>Penalties</li>
        <li>Cards (Yellow and Red)</li>
        <div class= "drilldown">
            <img src="drilldown3.jpg" width="400" height="300">
            <img src="drilldown4.jpg" width="80" height="300">
        </div>
        </ul>
        <p>These in-game stats allow us to see the specifics of the match and another aspect
             of team play that contributes to a win or loss. Another aspect of this visual 
             is that when you double click on a certain bar of this chart you will see when that team previous has that
             exact stat in another game and whether they won, loss or tied. For example, when you double click on the bar
            of Leicester City's "crosses", it will show other games where this team has 13 crosses and what the outcome was of that game.
            The goal of that interaction is to show if that statistic, whether high or low, had an impact on the outcome of the game.
         </p>
        <h4>Color Choices</h4>
        <p>When deciding on colors, we wanted to select symbolic and stereotypical colors for the nodes, lines, and charts. 
                We also wanted to pick colors that will be visible for those users that are color blind or have 
                color impaired vision. We used the color blindness simulator, <a href="http://colororacle.org/">Color Oracle</a> to test if the colors
                 I chose would be sufficient with “Deuteranopia”, “Protanopia”, and “Tritanopia” color vision. 
                 Color Oracle is a color tool recommended by Dr. Reda.</p>
