Note for development:

We think we can visualize multiple seasons but not multiple leagues at the same time.

This means at the beginning of the visualization initialization, we have to have users tell us what season(s) and leage they want to visualize.

The data is in "points" form -- which means there is no elimination. This is good news because it means we don't have to handle consollation rounds.

There doesn't have to be order to the point placement and movement.

Each rectangular node would be the same color across all other matches during that season to present it as the same in case they choose multiple seasons to visualize.
